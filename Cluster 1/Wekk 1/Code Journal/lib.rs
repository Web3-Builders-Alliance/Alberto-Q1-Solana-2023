/*
What are the concepts (borrowing, ownership, vectors etc)
    solana_program is an instruction and inside there are vectors

What is the organization?, How the code is organized?

What is the contract doing? What is the mechanism?
    The program is processing the instructions provided by the entrypoint of what is connected
    with ProgramResult.

    This program requires four accounts, if there are not present then it will throw NotEnoughAccountKeys
    error.

How could it be better? More efficient? Safer?
    I think the way I've seen this layout has been where there is a
    lib.rs file and inside are public modules
    pub mod entrypoint;
    pub mod error;
    pub mod instruction;
    pub mod processor;
    pub mod state;

    and the the program code (like this one) is in processo.rs

The code could be safer and better ifâ€¦..
